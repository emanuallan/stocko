<h1 align="center">Stock Web Applet</h1>


<div align="center">
  A small web applet that allows users to keep track of stocks and
                                    calculate profit gains and losses, as well as, equity percentages. Created this with
                                    the
                                    purpose of practicing with React's hook features (useState, useEffect) that came
                                    with the release of v16.

## üç≠ Characteristics
- Input stock symbol, cost per share (price you bought each share for), and the quantity bought, then you'll get a few statistics about your holdings.
- Pie chart created with Chart.js (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2)
- Hosted with Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/)


## üì¶ Installation & Setup
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/emanuallan/stocko.git
$ cd stocko
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

- This should run the web applet and allow you start inputting values.

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Known Bugs
- I did not spend much time with error handling (as it wasn't my main focus for this project) so admittingly there's a lot of assuming that the user submits the proper inputs.
